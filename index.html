                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>Student performance is influenced by a combination of academic habits, socio-economic background,
                    parental involvement, and external environmental factors. By analyzing these diverse factors, we aim
                    to determine which variables — such as study hours, attendance, motivation levels, and access to
                    resources — have the greatest impact on academic success and how they interact with each other to
                    influence student outcomes.</p>
                <p>Our research question focuses on identifying the key factors influencing student academic performance
                    and understanding how they impact exam scores. This analysis can provide valuable insights for
                    educators, policymakers, and parents to design better support systems that improve student outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>The analysis plan for our dataset will consist of the following tasks:</p>

                <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
                <p>Our analysis utilizes the Student Performance Factors Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 6,607
                    observations and 20 features. The dataset includes a mix of categorical variables (such as school
                    type and gender) and continuous variables (such as study hours and exam scores). It provides
                    comprehensive information on various personal, academic, and socio-economic factors that may
                    influence student success. However, additional data on learning environments, teacher interaction,
                    and psychological well-being can be better understood with extra analysis.</p>
                <p>The attributes in our dataset include Hours_Studied, Attendance, Parental_Involvement,
                    Access_to_Resources, Extracurricular_Activities, Sleep_Hours, Previous_Scores, Motivation_Level,
                    Internet_Access, Tutoring_Sessions, Family_Income, Teacher_Quality, School_Type, Peer_Influence,
                    Physical_Activity, Learning_Disabilities, Parental_Education_Level, Distance_from_Home, Gender,
                    Exam_Score.</p>

                <h3>Visualization 1: Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features</h3>
                <iframe src="correlation_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="700px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This is a correlation heatmap of numerical features from the
                    student performance dataset.
                    It visually represents how strongly each pair of numerical variables is related, using color
                    intensity to indicate
                    correlation values. The color bar on the right shows the scale, ranging from -1 (perfect negative
                    correlation)
                    to +1 (perfect positive correlation). </p>
                <p> The correlation heatmap reveals that Attendance is the strongest predictors
                    of exam scores, followed by Hours Studied and Previous Scores, which also shows a positive but
                    slightly
                    weaker correlation. While Tutoring Sessions, Sleep Hours, and Physical Activity show little to no
                    correlation.
                    This suggests that consistent academic habits and personal study time are key drivers of
                    performance, whereas
                    well-being and support factors may play a less direct role in short-term exam outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Visualization 2: Exam Score vs Numeric Feature</h3>
                <iframe src="exam_score_vs_numeric_feature.html" width="100%" height="550px"
                    style="border:none;"></iframe>
                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This graph is a scatter plot showing the relationship between
                    hours studied and exam scores.
                    Each point represents a student, with the x-axis indicating the number of hours they studied and the
                    y-axis showing their exam score.
                    The scatter plots reveal that hours studied has the strongest visible relationship with exam scores.
                    As students study more, their scores generally increase, with the highest performers often studying
                    over 25 hours. While there's
                    still some variation, the trend suggests that increased study time contributes positively to
                    performance. Attendance, on the other
                    hand, shows only a slight upward trend. Most students, regardless of how often they attended, scored
                    between 60 and 80, indicating
                    that attendance alone doesn't strongly influence outcomes. </p>
                <p> Sleep hours appear to have no meaningful impact on exam scores. Students across all sleep
                    ranges—from 4 to 10 hours—achieved similar
                    results, suggesting that while sleep may affect general well-being, it doesn't directly reflect in
                    exam performance in this dataset.
                    Surprisingly, previous scores also show only a mild correlation. Although one might expect strong
                    past performance to predict future
                    success, the plot reveals a wide variation in current exam results among students with high previous
                    scores. This implies that while
                    previous performance offers some context, it's not a guaranteed indicator of current outcomes, and
                    other factors like effort, motivation,
                    and support may play a greater role.</p>

                <h3>Visualization 3: Exam Score by Categorical Feature</h3>
                <iframe src="exam_score_by_categorical_feature.html" width="100%" height="570px"
                    style="border:none;"></iframe>
                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This graph is a boxplot comparing exam scores across different
                    levels of motivation (High,
                    Medium and Low). Each box represents the distribution of scores for one motivation category, with
                    the box showing the interquartile
                    range (IQR), the line inside the box showing the median, and the dots representing outliers. Across
                    the board, the boxplots reveal
                    subtle but consistent trends in how different categorical factors relate to exam performance:
                <ul>
                    <li> Motivation Level: Students with high or medium motivation have slightly higher average exam
                        scores than those with low motivation. This suggests that internal drive contributes positively
                        to performance, though the gap is not huge. </li>
                    <li> Parental Involvement: Higher parental involvement is associated with better exam scores.
                        Students with involved parents scored roughly 1.7 points higher on average compared to those
                        with low involvement, indicating that support at home plays a measurable role. </li>
                    <li> Access to Resources and Internet Access: These features tend to align with higher scores,
                        reinforcing the idea that access to educational tools and online learning opportunities provides
                        an academic advantage. </li>
                    <li> Teacher Quality: Students taught by teachers rated as "High" quality consistently perform
                        better. This reflects the importance of effective instruction and teaching support in driving
                        academic success. </li>
                    <li> Family Income and Parental Education Level: Students from higher-income households and families
                        with more educated parents generally perform better, suggesting that socioeconomic background
                        and educational culture at home matter. </li>
                    <li> Extracurricular Activities: Those involved in extracurriculars often score slightly higher,
                        possibly due to better time management, discipline, or mental balance. </li>
                    <li> Learning Disabilities: Students with identified learning disabilities have lower average
                        scores, highlighting the need for enhanced academic support structures. </li>
                    <li> Peer Influence and School Type: Positive peer influence and attending schools with better
                        reputations (like private or well-resourced public schools) are modestly linked to higher
                        scores. </li>
                    <li> Gender and Distance from Home: These show minimal differences, suggesting that performance is
                        more shaped by academic, social, and support-based factors than demographic or logistical ones.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Visualization 4: Linked Scatter & Box Plot</h3>
                <iframe src="scatter_and_boxplot_linked.html" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This graph demonstrates the difference between Hours Studied,
                    Exam Scores, and Sleep Hours.
                    On the graph to the left, you can select a range of hours studied and a range of exam scores. After
                    selecting a range,
                    you can see boxplots for hours of sleep and exam scores that correlate to the area selected.
                    Overall, this shows that
                    sleep hours do not have that much impact on exam scores because it seems like the median for each
                    amount of sleep is very
                    close, no matter what range is chosen on the left graph.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This bar plot represents the number of tutoring sessions and
                    family income. Low-income
                    and high-income families are getting the same number of tutoring sessions, while middle-income

                <p><strong>Summary and Takeaway:</strong> This visualization demonstrates Parental Education Level,
                    Parental Involvement, and Average
                    of Exam Score broken down by School Type. The color represents Parental Education Level and Parental
                    Involvement. Size
                    shows the average of the Exam Score. No matter what school type or parental education level,
                    students with low parental
                    involvement get lower exam scores than students with medium or high parental involvement.
                    Additionally, students whose
                    parents receive a higher level of education seem to do better than students whose parents received a
                    lower level of education.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>What Did We Learn?</h3>
                <p>We initially thought that a lot of different variables that could not be easily changed like family
                    income would
                    affect the exam scores, however after looking at our visualizations it seems that we were wrong. It
                    seems like for
                    the most part the different factors don't affect exam performances at all, with the exception of
                    hours studied and attendance. </p>
                <p>Additionally, across different school types and parental education levels, children whose parents are
                    more involved with their education outperform their peers. Overall it seems like the easiest way to
                    boost exam scores is to attend class and increase the amount of hours spent studying (in
                    moderation). </p>

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p>For future work, this dataset offers a rich opportunity to dive deeper into predictive modeling and
                    behavioral insights.
                    One valuable direction would be to build a machine learning model—such as a random forest or
                    gradient boosting regressor—to
                    predict exam scores based on both categorical and numerical features. This could help identify
                    non-obvious patterns and rank
                    feature importance more precisely. Additionally, clustering techniques could be used to group
                    students by performance profiles,
                    revealing distinct learning personas (e.g., high-effort/high-score vs. low-effort/high-score
                    students).
                </p>
                <p>Another area to explore is interaction effects—for example, how motivation level modifies the impact
                    of study hours or tutoring.
                    Finally, time-based data, if available in future versions, could help understand trends in
                    improvement or decline over multiple assessments, offering more personalized insights for educators
                    and policy-makers.</p>
